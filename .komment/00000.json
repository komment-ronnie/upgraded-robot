        "description": "A simple minesweeper game using a two-dimensional integer array 'grid' representing a grid with size NxN, where each cell has a value of either 0 (empty) or 1 (mine). The code implements functions to solve the game by iteratively exploring the grid and marking cells as mine or empty. The main function calls these functions recursively until all mines are found or the grid is fully explored. Additionally, the code provides a print result method to display the final state of the grid.",
