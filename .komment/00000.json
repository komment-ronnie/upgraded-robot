        "description": "a class called \"MineSweeper\" that implements a simple Mine Sweeper game in Java. The code uses various methods and classes from the `java.util` package to perform tasks such as counting the number of alive neighbors of a given cell, finding orphan nodes (i.e., nodes with no alive neighbors), and printing the grid layout of the minesweeper game.\n\nThe main function of the code is to solve a Mine Sweeper game by iterating over the entire grid, using the `neighbors` method to find the number of alive neighbors of a given cell, and the `orphanDetected` method to detect orphan nodes (i.e., nodes with no alive neighbors). When an orphan node is detected, the code prints a message indicating that an orphan has been found.\n\nOnce all orphan nodes have been detected, the code uses the `printResult` method to print out the layout of the grid, with each row represented as a list of integers and each integer separated by two spaces for padding. A new line is printed at the end of each row.",

The class has several methods for determining the moves available to the knight at each position, counting the number of neighbors of a given cell, and checking if a cell is an orphan (i.e., has no alive neighbors). The `printResult()` method prints the values stored in the grid array with each row represented as a list of integers.",
